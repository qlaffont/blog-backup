## Discord x Stripe¬†: Simple payment integration ‚ö°Ô∏è


> I have created a service who is called OnlyDfans to make this configuration for you¬†! More information to https://onlydfans.io

As a developer, I have coded many bot with Discord.js.

I have created a bot recently, **‚ÄúDiscord Protector‚Äù**. It‚Äôs a Global Ban Management bot with many extra features ([https://discord-protector.qlaffont.com](https://discord-protector.qlaffont.com)).

I want to enable extra features with subscription quickly and in a simple way. Solution: **Stripe**

## Todo-list

To enable extra features, I need to achieve this todo-list :

1 ‚Äî üí≥ Redirect user to Stripe to pay subscription

2 ‚Äî üë®‚Äçüíª Create a customer platform to manage subscriptions

3 ‚Äî üñ• Receive Stripe webhook to enable extra features

## I. üí≥ Stripe Checkout

For people who don‚Äôt know, [Stripe](https://stripe.com) is a payments infrastructure. It‚Äôs a famous platform and many website use it (Deliveroo, Banking, Asos, etc.).

One of the most famous product is **Stripe Checkout**. This product create for you a checkout page with everything (Branding, Product details, etc.).

![Stripe Checkout](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619599321533/MR_32W9Iy.gif)*Stripe Checkout*

This product **will reduce for me a lot of coding time**.

After reading [Stripe Checkout Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout), I know that I need to create a Stripe Customer and generate a Stripe URL when user want to pay his subscription. (In this case, when user type in channel *!banp pay*)

```
const stripeUser = await stripe.customers.create();
    
//Save stripe customer id in db -> stripeUser.id

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create(
{
      payment_method_types: ["card"],
      line_items: [
        {
          price: PRODUCT_PRICEID,
          quantity: 1,
        },
      ],
      customer: stripeUser.id,
      mode: "subscription",
      success_url: "MY_SUCCESS_URL",
      cancel_url: "MY_CANCEL_URL"
});

// Url to send to user in private message
url = `/payment-page?CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID=${session.id}`;
```


And I have created a webpage to redirect user to checkout page :

```
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      var stripe = Stripe('MY_STRIPE_KEY');

      var urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

      stripe.redirectToCheckout({
      sessionId: urlParams.get('CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID')
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```


**Step 1 - Done** ‚úÖ

## **II. üë®‚Äçüíª Stripe Billing Customer Portal**

Recently, I have seen on ProductHunt a [post](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/stripe-billing-customer-portal) for Stripe Billing Customer Portal.

![Stripe Billing Customer Portal](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619599323965/_dhbaQELi.png)*Stripe Billing Customer Portal*

It‚Äôs a new product released by Stripe Team who **create a Stripe-hosted page for customers to manage subscriptions (Change Plan, Cancel Plan) and to manage invoices**.

Perfect, now I know that this step is simple like step 1.

After reading [Stripe Billing Customer Portal](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/integrating-customer-portal), I know that I just need to communicate a stripe url to user.

```
const session = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
   customer: server.stripeCustomerId,
   return_url: "MY_RETURN_URL",
});

//Send url to user in private message -> session.url
```


**Step 2 - Done** ‚úÖ

## III. üñ• Stripe Webhook Integration

To handle Stripe Webhook, I need to create an HTTP Route to receive events. To do that, I use [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) but you can use what you want to make an HTTP Server.

```
f.post("/webhook", async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
    const event = request.body;
    switch (event.type) {
      case "checkout.session.completed":

        //Save Customer ID and save the fact that now he can use Stripe Billing Customer Portal

        break;
      case "customer.subscription.updated":
        
        // Check product id and save subscription date end (event.data.object.current_period_end)

        break;
      case "customer.subscription.deleted":

        // Check product id and save subscription date end (event.data.object.current_period_end)

      default:
        // Unexpected event type
        return reply.status(400).send();
    }

    reply.send({ received: true });
  });
```


**Step 3 - Done** ‚úÖ

(Step 4 - Test with [Stripe testing cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) to check if everything work.)

## Conclusion

It tooks me less than 1 day to integrate payment in my Discord.js bot.

Stripe documentation is simple and integration is very fast ‚ö°Ô∏è. Now you know how to integrate Stripe in Discord.js bot without any website to create.
